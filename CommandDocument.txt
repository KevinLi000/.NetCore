# Creating a New C# Interface File

The `dotnet new interface` command creates a new C# interface file template.

## What This Does

This command generates a basic `.cs` file with an empty interface declaration. By default, it uses the current directory name as the namespace and "Interface1" as the interface name.

## Example Usage

To create an interface with a custom name:

```bash
dotnet new interface -n IMyService
```

To create the interface in a specific folder:

```bash
dotnet new interface -o Interfaces -n IRepository
```

## Generated File Example

The command will create a file that looks something like this:

```csharp
namespace YourNamespace
{
    public interface Interface1
    {
        
    }
}
## Options
- `-n|--name` - Sets the name of the interface
